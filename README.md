This project implements a basic 10-day vs 30-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) crossover trading strategy using Python.

###  What it does:
- Downloads real stock data using yfinance
- Calculates short-term (SMA10) and long-term (SMA30) moving averages
- Generates Buy/Sell signals based on crossover logic
- Visualizes price and signals using Matplotlib

###  Tools Used:
- Python
- pandas, NumPy
- yfinance
- matplotlib

### ðŸ”œ Planned Next Steps:
- Add backtesting logic
- Calculate Sharpe Ratio
- Compare with Buy-and-Hold baseline

This was built as part of my summer learning in quantitative finance.
